# Building-pipelines

This is a Jenkins Pipeline script written in Groovy, which defines a continous integration and continous deployment (CI/CD) process. 

Overall this pipeline script defines a basic (CD/CI) process that involves checking out code, building it, running tests, deploying it, and then taking appropriate actions based on whether the build succeeds or fails. 

This assignment was proctored by my trainer.
